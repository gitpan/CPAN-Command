NAME
    CPAN::Command - Load CPAN command plugins

VERSION
    version 1.100840

SYNOPSIS
        # sudo perl -MCPAN::Command -e 'CPAN::shell()'
        # cpan> repo Foo::Bar
        # cpan> homepage Foo::Bar
        # cpan> bugtracker Foo::Bar

DESCRIPTION
    This module is a plugin loader for CPAN commands in the
    "CPAN::Commmand::*" namespace.

        # sudo perl -MCPAN::Command -e 'CPAN::shell()'

    will load all command plugins in that namespace, then run the CPAN shell
    as usual. The pluggable commands are now available. For an example of
    such a command see CPAN::Command::Bugtracker.

    This module also loads the CPAN package so you can run, for example, its
    "shell()" function.
